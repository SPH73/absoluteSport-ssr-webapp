        </h1>
        <p>Join us for a day dedicated to family!</p>
        <p>
          At our family fun day, we can spend time together building and
          renewing connections with our loved ones and within our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will have games including a family tug of war or maybe you want to
          have a go at knocking your sibling off of the duel podium?
        </p>
        <p>
          Would you prefer a quieter activity in the woods or doing some craft
          activities, we have those too!
        </p>
        <p>
          To top it all off we will have a community barbecue and finish the day
          with a disco. Bring your family and let's have fun as a community!
        </p>
