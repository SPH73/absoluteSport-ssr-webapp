          Who doesnâ€™t love meeting a superhero, dressing up like a Pirate or
          playing Survival?
        </p>
        <p>
          Each one of our Holiday Camp days has a different theme in store for
          the children. Our days are fun-filled and exciting, helping your
          children to spend the school break in laughter while building new
          friendships and life-long memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our camps are suitable for children of all abilities between 5 and 12
          years old and provide an opportunity to stay active throughout the
          school holidays by participating in a wide range of fun, exciting
          sports, games and art projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our camps are structured and delivered by our coaches trained in
          coaching children in sports. The team will ensure that your child
          feels included in all the fun so that they build not only skills in
          sports but also socially and emotionally (self-esteem and confidence).
        </p>

          are running below.
